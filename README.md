# Logical 
The Constructed language I created with [GPT-Neox](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox) is simple and logical. It is composed of five core properties:

1. Grammatical Rules – Constructed language is based on a series of logical, formalized rules that allow for complex sentence structure. There are no ambiguities in the grammar, and no exceptions to the rules.

2. Phonology – Constructed language follows a specific set of sounds and letter combinations that allows for uniformity in pronunciation and understanding.

3. Vocabulary – Constructed language uses a restricted set of vocabulary terms that are easily understood by humans. The terms have been specifically selected to allow for precision and clarity.

4. Syntax – Constructed language is constructed around a series of patterns that are easily understandable. This helps ensure a consistent approach to word choice, and to make the language simpler to learn and use.

5. Readability – Constructed language is designed to be easily readable, with short, clear words and sentences that are unambiguous and straightforward.

All together, these properties ensure a language that is precise and easy to use.
